Following independence, Ukraine declared itself a neutral state.[13] but nonetheless formed a limited military partnership with the Russian Federation, other CIS countries and a partnership with NATO since 1994. In the 2000s, the government began leaning towards NATO, and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002. It was later agreed that the question of joining NATO should be answered by a national referendum at some point in the future.[14] Recently deposed President Viktor Yanukovych considered the current level of co-operation between Ukraine and NATO sufficient,[15] and was against Ukraine joining NATO.[16] In 2013, protests against the government of President Yanukovych broke out in downtown Kiev after the government made the decision to suspend the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement and seek closer economic ties with Russia, this began a several months long wave of demonstrations and protests known as the Euromaidan, of which later escalated into a full on revolution that ultimately resulted in the overthrowing of Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government. These events precipitated the breakout of the Crimean Crisis with Russia in February 2014, and the War in Donbass in March 2014; both are still ongoing as of September 2015.
